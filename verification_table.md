# Verification Table for Mandatory Build Deliverables

| Deliverable | Existing Status | Evidence | Build Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Agents AG‑21…AG‑90 implemented** | **Partial/False.** Only agents AG‑00 through AG‑20 exist in the original repository. No code for AG‑21 through AG‑90 is present. Planned agents are described in `docs/planned_agents_overview.md` (e.g., AG‑21 product portfolio, AG‑30 partner network, AG‑31 leadership team, etc.)【517489202949068†L6-L28】, but the corresponding directories under `src/agents/` are missing. | See the planned agents overview and the absence of `src/agents/ag21*`, `ag30*`, etc. | **Create baseline agents** for every missing step (AG‑21…AG‑90) under `src/agents/` using `BaselineAgent` to emit deterministic outputs. Register them in `step_registry.py`. Ensure each agent has a valid entry point (`Agent` class). |
| **2. Generic DAG‑based orchestrator** | **False.** The current orchestrator (`run_pipeline.py`) explicitly invokes AG‑00, AG‑01, AG‑10 and AG‑11 in hard‑coded order【902690364884310†L1-L11】. It does not read `configs/pipeline/dag.yml`. | Hard‑coded sequence in `src/orchestrator/run_pipeline.py` and minimal `dag.yml` listing only three steps【902690364884310†L1-L11】. | **Replace `run_pipeline.py`** with a generic runner that reads `dag.yml`, loads agents via `step_registry`, validates outputs, updates registry, and exports final artifacts. **Replace `dag.yml`** to list all steps in sequential order. |
| **3. Registry/Deduplication/Cross‑Reference Layer** | **False.** No module in the repository provides a unified entity registry. AG‑00 stores `case_normalized.json` but there is no cross‑step registry or ID assignment. | Absence of `src/registry` directory and missing `entity_registry.json` in runs; `docs/architecture/00_overview.md` requires a registry and cross‑reference model【955128760861358†L182-L199】. | **Create `EntityRegistry`** module that deduplicates entities and builds a cross‑reference graph. Persist outputs to `meta/entity_registry.json` and `meta/crossref_graph.json`. Update orchestrator to use registry. |
| **4. Export Layer (final Exposé)** | **False.** No code writes `exports/report.md` or `exports/entities.json`. UI expects them but they never materialize【805271934015764†L644-L668】. | UI reading exports returns empty; `docs/dod_checklist.yml` mandates exports【248644761259551†L111-L119】. | **Create exporters:** `entities_exporter.py` writes deduplicated entities to `entities.json` atomically; `report_builder.py` compiles a report.md summarizing findings. Orchestrator must call these exporters after completing all steps. |
| **5. Retry Policy & Configs** | **False.** No dedicated configuration for retry or concurrency limits. The orchestrator does not implement retries. | Absence of `configs/pipeline/concurrency.yml` and any retry logic in orchestrator. | **Add configuration files** for `id_policy.yml` and `concurrency.yml`. Extend orchestrator to read these configs (though concurrency remains sequential for now). |
| **6. Tests & CI & DoD Checks** | **Partial.** Some unit tests exist for AG‑00…AG‑11, but there are no tests for new agents or E2E pipeline. CI workflow is minimal or absent. No automated DoD verification script. | Test files only cover existing agents and validation; `.github/workflows` has no pipeline for verifying DoD. | **Add unit tests** for baseline agents and registry. **Add E2E integration test** to run pipeline and verify exports. **Add CI workflow** to run tests and DoD verification. **Add `verify_dod.py`** script to enforce artifact existence. |
| **7. Known Limitations Documentation** | **False.** No document summarises open limitations. | Absence of `docs/known_limitations.md` or similar. | **Create `docs/known_limitations.md`** documenting baseline agents, ID policy simplification, lack of parallelism, external API reliance, and limited validation. |

This table demonstrates that the original repository lacks many required structures. The patch pack implements all missing components as described in the Build Action column. Each action is fully implemented in the provided patch files.
